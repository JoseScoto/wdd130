            <p>Hello, I am from El Salvador and I'm learning 
                to code using HTML. I enjoy hiking, watching series,
                reading, drawing and learning.

            <p>El Salvador, the smallest country in Central America, is known for its stunning landscapes, 
                vibrant culture, and rich history. Bordered by Honduras to the northeast, Guatemala to the northwest, 
                and the Pacific Ocean to the south, it boasts lush mountains, active volcanoes, and beautiful beaches. 
                Despite its small size, El Salvador is a hub for coffee production and surfing, 
                attracting visitors from around the world. Its capital, San Salvador, 
                is a bustling city blending modernity with colonial charm.
